1. **`/backend`**: Contains all the backend code for the site
2. **`/docs`**: Contains all relevant documentation files
3. **`/src`**: Contains all the source code for the website.
   1. **`/components`**: Reusable React components.
      - Components are organized into folders, with the folder names being the page name/functionality that the components within are used for
      - Components that are not in any subfolders are used on multiple different pages, or for overall app functionality. Below is a description of these components:
        - LoadingWheel.js: Used in pages where you need to indicate loading
        - NavigationBar.js: Used in everypage to help users navigate between pages
   2. **`/graphql`**: Contains files for mutations, queries and the schema
   3. **`/reducers`**: Reducers for Login and Signup authentication states
   4. **`/views`**: Files for app routing
   5. **`/themes.js`**: Global styling for fonts. Note that most components have their own module-scoped styling.
